Welcome to my personal blog. If you haven't noticed yet, it is themed similarly to [OMORI](https://www.omori-game.com/). It is also an excuse for me to have a really simplistic theme without having to worry too much about coloring. I am honestly really bad at web design. I prefer backend or native programming. Doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying!

This blog will mostly be filled with my adventures in coding. I have a lot planned, especially game development with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). I'll also post ramblings about other things like gaming and anime.

Hope you enjoy your stay!
